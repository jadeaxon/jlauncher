Do as a practice project doing all Volere reqs, UML, etc.

Part of Mastler.ahk normal mode.  All code kept in JLauncher.ahk.

AHK: Ability to *quickly* start a countdown timer to timebox some activity.
	Might be part of JLauncher: <Win j>r 15 stop reading
		[A command might be parsed for embedded args r(\d+).]
		A command may then have additional space-separated args
		Maybe it just uses Slack for these reminders.  Maybe Slack API instead of automating GUI?

<W j> -- opens launcher; just a small text box
you type a 1-3 letter launch code and hit enter
mapping stored in ~/jlauncher.conf determines what happens
	[if ~/jlauncher_<host>.conf exists, these merge/override defs in main config] 
	<launch code> => <action>
	<action> is a Windows command or an AHK niladic (?) function in JLauncher.
	<action> can also be a file (which should have its default Windows action run on it).
		Using AHK "Run <path>" will do this.	
	Leading @ means use AHK function.
	# starts a comment.
	Space must surround the =>.
	ff => C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe
	bcp => @BedtimeColorProfile
	bed => @BedtimeColorProfile
	ncp => @NormalColorProfile
	Jr => @ReloadConfig
	Je => jlauncher.conf
		Relative paths are relative to user home dir.  You can use / as path separator.

Q. How do we populate a hash from a file in AHK?
